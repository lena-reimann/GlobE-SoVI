# GlobE-SoVI
Data processing and analysis for calculating the Global Empirical Social Vulnerability Index (GlobE-SoVI) produced as part of the study Reimann, L, Koks, E, de Moel, H, Ton, M & JCJH Aerts: "An empirical social vulnerability map for flood risk assessment at global scale (‘GlobE-SoVI’)" (accepted manuscript in Earth's Future). 
The three scripts include the following processing and analysis steps:

01_vulnerability_drivers = Preprocessing of potential social vulnerability drivers to raster data of 30 arc seconds (~1km) spatial resolution

02_flood_impact_analysis = Calculation of vulnerability variables for 913 past flood events and estimation of a linear multiple regression model to predict flood fatalities

03_GlobE-SoVI = Calculation of the GlobE-SoVI map based on five key vulnerability variables
